Create a download/upload folder (Ex. sync) in your local system.

mkdir /home/sk/sync

Change to the newly created ‘sync’ directory.

cd sync/

Run the following command for the first time.

grive -a

The above command will display an URL.

-----------------------
Please go to this URL and get an authentication code:

https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?scope=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fuserinfo.email+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fuserinfo.profile+https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Ffeeds%2F+https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.googleusercontent.com%2F+https%3A%2F%2Fspreadsheets.google.com%2Ffeeds%2F&redirect_uri=urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob&response_type=code&client_id=22314510474.apps.googleusercontent.com

-----------------------

Copy and paste that URL in your browser. Next, you’ll be asked to give permission to access your Google drive. Enter your gmail credentials. Finally, an authentication code will be displayed. Copy the authentication code and paste it in the Terminal where you ran “grive -a” command. That’s it.

Now, whenever you want to synchronize files/folders to and from your Google drive, go to the “sync” folder and run the following command:

cd /home/sk/sync/

sync

Note that you don’t have to include “-a” parameter every time. Because we already have authenticated with google drive.
